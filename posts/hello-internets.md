My name is __Steven Schobert__. I'm a web developer & designer living in Dallas, Texas. If you don't know me feel free to [say hi](http://twitter.com/stevenschobert) or [read more](/about) about me.

I came into web development about a year ago when I left my IT support position at [ITS](http://integrityserve.com) and started full-time at [Lockhart](http://lockhartadvantage.com) as a web developer. Since then, I've had the opportunity to learn a ton (I'm currently a one-man team) in everything from front-end html/css/javascript, to back-end php/ruby/python. I've __really loved getting involved__ in the community in places like [twitter](http://twitter.com/stevenschobert) and [dribbble](http://dribbble.com/stevenschobert). The level of talent and participation out there is incredible. Seriously, _you guys rock_.

Lately I've been wanting a place to share my own thoughts and __give back to the community__, so [I built one](http://github.com/stevenschobert/stevenschobert.com). I know that _I am no where near finished learning_, but hopefully the things I share along the way will help someone else.
