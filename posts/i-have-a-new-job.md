I'm happy to announce that I now work at [Amplifi Commerce](http://amplificommerce.com) as a __front-end developer__.

__Amplifi__ is a Dallas-based web agency that specializes in __e-commerce platforms__, and I'm excited to be on-board. There will a lot of learning opportunity for me there, and I'll get to work for some pretty _big-name clients_. It's also my first time to work in a team setting, so it will be nice to collaborate with other developers.

I enjoyed my time at [Lockhart](http://lockhartadvantage.com), and I'm sure the time I spent there will come in handy over the next several years. Being the only developer there, I got to work on every aspect of their web projects, from the first designs all the way to final piece of code. But I definitely feel like it's time for me to share some of those responsibilities with other awesome people, and Amplifi will be a _great place to do that_.

Changes are never easy, but this is one __change I feel good about__. And of course there will still be time for open-source projects and the occasional blog post. I'm excited to see what the future holds!
