[Chris Coyier](http://twitter.com/chriscoyier) wrote an article earlier this week about the monthly cost of services he uses for web development ([read it here](http://css-tricks.com/web-developer-economics-monthly-service-costs/)). I was fascinated so I jotted down some of my own services, but with a little twist.

Being a student and having just [bought my first apartment](https://twitter.com/stevenschobert/status/243399451606138880), money is a little tight. Luckily for me, lots of really great services offer __free & student pricing__, so I'm to keep my list pretty short.

### Student Accounts

* Adobe Creative Cloud: Student Edition _($29.99/month)_
* Github: Micro Plan _(Student/Free)_
* Treehouse: Gold Plan _(Student/Free)_

I use the entire CS6 collection regularly, so it's my most expensive item on the list. Github offers [free micro accounts](http://github.com/edu) for students, which fits my current needs really well. Also, I was lucky enough to [win a scholarship](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/winners-of-the-3-million-scholarship-giveaway-announced) from [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com).

### Free Accounts

* Dropbox: Basic _(Free)_
* Amazon Web Services _(Free)_
* Pagodabox: Basic _(Free)_

I use a combination of [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com), [Arq](http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/), and [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/free/) to keep all of my documents synced and backed up in the cloud. I use [Pagodabox](http://pagodabox.com) to host [this blog](http://github.com/stevenschobert/stevenschobert.com).

### Paid Accounts

* Cheddar: Plus _($1.99/month)_
* Dribbble: Pro _($20/year)_
* Gauges: Solo _($6/month)_
* Verizon FIOS _($69.99/month)_

Since my budget is so small, the service has to pretty special to make it on the paid list. I use [Cheddar](http://cheddarapp.com) to keep my life organized, [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/stevenschobert) to post design work, and [Gauges](http://gaug.es) to track my web traffic. My apartment is wired with Verizon FIOS, so I'm able to get 15Mbs/5Mbs, which is a plus.

### Total Monthly Cost: $109.64

It's a pretty modest list, but it works really well for me at this point. I left out a couple services like [Rdio](http://rd.io) & [Hulu](http://hulu.com), since they are mainly for entertainment but are definitely worth buying nonetheless.

Have any recommendations for what I should add to the list next? [Tweet](http://twitter.com/stevenschobert) them to me!
